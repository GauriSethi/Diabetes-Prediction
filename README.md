# Diabetes-Prediction
### Data Description
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The Diabetes Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics.Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old. The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of diabetes, enabling early intervention and management.
